# Certification of Analysis and Review
The tables and figures in this analysis (*`r config$Desc_Name`*) were generated with software freely available at [**GitHub@cnobles**](https://github.com/cnobles) and were subsequently reviewed together by the `r paste(names(config$signature$positions), collapse = " and ")`.

**Verifying signatures**

```{r sig_block}
null <- lapply(seq_along(config$signature$positions), function(i){
  cat(paste0(
    paste(config$signature$positions[[i]], collapse = ": "), "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\vspace*{1\\baselineskip}\n",
    "X____________________    date: ___________________\n",
    "\\vspace*{2\\baselineskip}\n\n"))
})
```
